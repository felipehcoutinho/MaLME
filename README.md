# Practice I
- Format your dataset
- Evaluate the associations among predictor variables
- Perform exploratory analysis on the predictors
- Train, test, and evaluate multiple ANN/RF models for a single taxon or group of taxa
- Perform Importance analysis
- Gather info on each model about: Importance and Performance
- Use the models to make predictions for different scenarios of environmental alterations (e.g. increases in temperature / nutrients, or their combined effects
  
# Practice II
- Format your dataset
- Evaluate the associations among predictor variables
- Perform exploratory analysis on the predictors
- Train, test, and evaluate multiple RF models for a single taxon or group of taxa
- Perform Importance analysis
- Gather info on each model about: Importance and Performance
- Use the models to determine which taxa are the best predictors for each environmental parameter

# Evaluation Criteria
- What is your dataset
- What is the goal of your model(s)
- Which type and how many models you build 
- How did you evaluate model performance
- How did the model perform on training, validation, and test sets
- Predictor importance analysis
- Why did your model(s) perform as they did
- Potential applications of the models
- Predictions for different scenarios (if applicable)
